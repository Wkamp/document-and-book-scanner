# document-and-book-scanner
## Sometimes I don't want the cloud
I often times have to scan in my math homework, and it's really annoying having to upload the images, download them to my pc, then reupload them to my course.
The google drive scanner also has the annoying habbit of flipping my images when I hold my phone flat above a document, as such I've made a simple scanner I can run on my pc instead.

I've also added a book mode to increase the efficiency of scanning books. Instead of having to move your phone or book back and forth between pages, you can instead have a fixed camera and take pictures of all right pages and all left pages separately, as they are then interweaved for you.
